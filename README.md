# THE DONKEY

1981: Donkey ran in code.  
2000s: Donkey ran in systems.  
Now: Donkey runs in culture.

---

## Overview

The Donkey is not a meme invented for attention.  
It is a symbol that has moved quietly through the evolution of technology.

---

## Origin — Code Era

The Donkey first appeared in **DONKEY.BAS** during the earliest days of personal computing.

It was not a mascot.  
It was not a joke.

It was a simple obstruction in a program, testing how humans interacted with machines.

---

## Continuity — System Era

As software evolved into structured systems and managed frameworks,  
the Donkey did not disappear.

It returned in **Donkey .NET**, bridging generations of programming paradigms.

---

## Now — Culture Era

Today, systems are abstract and difficult to read.  
Culture has responded with a new human interface: the meme.

**Donkey.meme** is not a reinvention.  
It is the continuation of the same Donkey,  
now expressed in the dominant language of the internet.

---

## Community

The Donkey was once written by programmers.  
It was once carried by systems.

Now, it is carried by people.

The creator introduces the Donkey.  
What it becomes is decided by the community that chooses to walk with it.
